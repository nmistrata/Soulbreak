## Building

We use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to keep track of large files, 
so you must install the Git LFS extension before you can commit/push code 
to the repo. Once Git LFS is installed on your machine (and you restart 
your terminal emulator), you don't need to do anything else; just commit 
and push as usual. 

Then, import the project into 
[Unity 2018.2.14](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&download_nid=58615&os=Win).

**Before you commit and push**, make sure you're committing the correct 
changes to the repo (run `git status` before you `git add` and after you `git commit`).
